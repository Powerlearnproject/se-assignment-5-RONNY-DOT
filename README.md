Configure the Launch Configuration:

Edit launch.json to specify the program to debug, arguments, environment variables, and other settings as needed. Example for a Python script:
json
Copy code
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
Save launch.json.
Set Breakpoints:

Navigate to the file where you want to set breakpoints.
Click in the gutter next to the line number or press F9 to set a breakpoint. Breakpoints pause execution of the program at that line for inspection.
Start Debugging:

Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar, then click on the green play button (▶️ Start Debugging) or press F5.
VS Code launches the debugger according to the configured launch configuration.
Debugging Controls:

Use the debug toolbar to control the debugging session:
Step Over (F10): Executes the current line and moves to the next line.
Step Into (F11): Steps into functions called from the current line.
Step Out (Shift + F11): Steps out of the current function.
Continue (F5): Resumes execution until the next breakpoint or the program ends.
Stop (Shift + F5): Stops the debugger and terminates the program.
Inspect Variables and Call Stack:

While debugging, view and interact with variables in the Debug Console and the Variables pane.
Use the Call Stack pane to navigate through the stack frames.
Evaluate Expressions:

Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and run commands in the context of the program being debugged.
